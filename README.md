    <summary><h3>🏋️‍♂️ About Me 🏈<h3></summary>
        Hi, my name is Roan Morgan. Since a very young age, I have always been interested in all things technology. Even more importantly, how technology influences our world. I first began on this tech focused journey in middle school. I had taken a class there called "Exploring Technology". This class consisted of basic html/css, arduino, and lego robotics. This sparked an ever-growing curiosity about tech that hasn't left me since. I have continued to pursue and build on my interests in community college. I hope to enter the field of tech and work on a project that will influence the physical world around us.
